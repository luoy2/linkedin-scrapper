# linkedin-scrapper
python script to help submitting resume; potential machine learning algo to get the right position for user

# Overview
It is harder and harder to find a job for financial engineers/mathematic finance, especially everyone wants to be a quant. 

From my expierence, the key to become a good quant is to strength one's math/computer science/statistc skills. However, even if you have a strong quant background, it is really tricky to find your first job. You need to send hundreds and throusands of resume and it is really time killing. I hope this repo can help the fresh graduated students save some time strenghth their quant backgound, instead of submitting resume like a machine.

# Things in mind
1. figure out how to submit resume automatically through linkedin quick apply
2. scrapping linkedin recruiter email address to send cold emails
3. build a supervised learning algorithm to decide if a position fit a candidate or not
